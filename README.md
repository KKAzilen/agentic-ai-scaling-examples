# Agentic AI Scaling Examples

This repository provides example scripts and configurations for scaling and hardening Agentic AI workflows. It is designed to help engineers move from sandbox prototypes to production-ready setups quickly.

## Included Examples

- **Caching Layer** (`caching_layer.py`)  
  Implements Redis caching for repeated LLM queries to reduce latency and API costs.

- **Async Batching** (`batch_api_caller.py`)  
  Demonstrates asynchronous batching of API calls for efficient agent operations.

- **Load Testing** (`load_test_scenarios/locustfile.py`)  
  Example load test scenario using Locust to simulate agent activity under peak conditions.

- **Monitoring Dashboard** (`monitoring_dashboard.json`)  
  Starter Grafana dashboard configuration for observing latency, error rates, and usage metrics.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/agentic-ai-scaling-examples.git
   cd agentic-ai-scaling-examples

2. **Install dependencies**:

- Python packages: redis, aiohttp, locust

- Ensure Redis server is running if you want to test caching.

- Grafana for importing the monitoring dashboard JSON.

3. **Review and run the scripts**:

- (`caching_layer.py`): Use as a reference for caching repeated LLM calls.

- (`batch_api_caller.py`): Run async batches of API requests.

- (`load_test_scenarios/locustfile.py`): Launch Locust to simulate load.

- (`monitoring_dashboard.json`): Import into Grafana to visualize metrics.
